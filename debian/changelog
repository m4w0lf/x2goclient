x2goclient (4.1.2.3-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.3):
    - Load alternative image resources from specified folder.
    - Set correct aspect ratio for x2go and ON logos.
    - Download alternative resource files from http server.
    - Support for PNG background images.
    - Display state of broker connection in status bar.
    - Client can synchronize sessions with broker. Broker need to send
      syncinterval value in the client config section.

    - set clipboard mode of x2gokdriveclient in cmd line option.
    - Fix maximizing client window in thinclient mode with Qt5 (bullseye).
    - Add mime type application/x-x2go. X2Go Client can now automatically open
      session files with .x2go extension.
    - X2Go Client will send it's version to the broker when sending client
      event.
    - Don't close X2Go Client if settings dialog is called before broker auth.

    - x2goclient.pro: use the right C++ standard library on OS X/macOS.

  [ Melroy van den Berg ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.3):
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: send EOF before closing channel.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: return false if login check remote command
      execution failed.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: refactor some of the channel loop and fix
      channel/session closes.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: fix 'when not' password auth. Avoids double
      error messages.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: correct retval check.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.c: explicitly mark function parameters as unused.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.3):
    - src/sshmasterconnection.{c,h}: fix builds, new function should have been
      registered and not static, but private.
  * debian/control:
    + Move to debian/control.in.
  * debian/control.in:
    + Switch to priority: optional. "extra" has been deprecated long ago.
      Pulled from Mike's changes.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Switch Upstream-Contact to myself. Pulled from Mike's changes.
  * debian/:
    + New file "watch". We won't need this per se (since we're upstream and
      there cannot be a newer version of the Debian package without releasing
      it first), but it might make downstream's life easier. Or not, depending
      on whether it's kept up-to-date correctly or not. Pulled from Mike's
      changes.
    + New file "upstream/metadata". Same reasoning as for "watch". Pulled from
      Mike's changes.

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.3):
    - Makefile: Install x-x2go.xml MIME database source file for .x2go file
      extension.
  * debian/x2gocient.install:
    + Install x-x2go.xml into bin:pkg x2goclient.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    + Install x-x2go.xml into bin:pkg and run update-mime-database during
      postinst.

x2goclient (4.1.2.2-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.2):
    - Add SSH instruction to list of errors if keyboard-interactive auth has
      failed.
    - Add new brocker feature. Broker can send to client some configuration in
      the section START_CLIENT_CONFIG - END_CLIENT_CONFIG. For the moment is
      supported option events=bool. If true, client sending to broker events:
      CONNECTING, CONNECTED, SUSPENDING, TERMINATING, FINISHED. It's not a real
      session state, but rather the state of X2Go Client.
    - Save session command in resumingSession.command.
    - Send in broker event the duration of session on client.
    - If client is configured to send events, the broker can ask client to send
      ALIVE events. To do this, broker should send config option "liveevent"
      (int).
      It means, if liveevent=10, client will send ALIVE event to broker every
      10 seconds when the client connected to X2Go Session.
    - Broker can send to client command to suspend or terminate the session as
      an answer to the client event message. For this broker should send to
      client SUSPEND ID or TERMINATE ID.
    - Client now sends "login" parameter to the broker when executing task
      "selectsession". Before client just sent a username on the broker and it
      was imposiible to find out user name on X2Go server, which is not always
      the same as broker username. This won't break a compatibility with
      previous broker as they just will ignore this parameter.
    - X2Gokdrive support for X2GoClient.
    - Fix authentification on http broker when sending event.
    - Fix resuming sessions on multiple servers.
    - Initializing sessionId, command and display for direct RDP to complay
      with standard sessions.
    - Direct RDP sesion send to broker event CONNECTED instead of CONNECTING at
      start of RDP client.
    - Fixing setting correct session command when resuming the session.
    - Don't exit if sending event to http broker has failed.
    - If using x2go broker and ssh proxy check for the option
      "usebrokeruserforproxy" in the session file. If it's "true", use the same
      username for the proxy as broker login.
    - Broker can send to client the number of suspended and running sessions
      for each session type.
      Client will display this information to user on session button.
    - update copyright years in about dialog.
    - Do not show password in debug output of HTTP broker.
    - Fix crashing if the path for automount in the session config file in
      wrong format. Supporting both Windows and Linux path in automount format.
      Check if path exists before mounting.
    - Do not show Pulseaudio warning on Windows, if Pulseaudio is disabled in
      settings or by command line.
    - Improve request handling in HTTP broker.
    - Add possibility to suspend and terminate sessions from session selection
      dialog in broker mode.
    - Do not delete session from list if terminating of session is canceled.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.2):
    - src/printwidget.cpp: add QButtonGroup include, fixes compile errors with
      Qt 5.11+. Fixes: #1307.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PulseAudio 12.1 since it's now available
      in MacPorts.
    - x2goclient.pro: detect libssh and libssh_threads via pkgconfig on
      UNIX-based platforms. libssh_threads is optional if the libssh version
      is high enough.
    - x2goclient.pro: let static Linux configuration override the new
      pkgconfig-based libssh usage.
    - x2goclient.pro: make system a non-variable call.
    - x2goclient.pro: fix qmake control flow for libssh logic, we really
      wanted to use else if for the Windows section and have the general else
      section being the general fallback.
    - x2goclient.pro: fix quoting issue in system() call. Qmake's quoting
      rules are really weird.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PulseAudio 12.2 since it's now available
      in MacPorts.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_cs.ts: whitespace and other fixups.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: change HTTP to HTTPS links where needed.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: do not spawn UNIX cleanup helper if arguments that
      let X2Go Client terminate right away have been passed. More work is
      needed here, but that should cover the most basic bits.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: remove left-over references to agentCheckTimer
      and slotCheckAgentProcess ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix various broken qCritical () calls.
    - src/{onmainwindow.{cpp,h},{sshmasterconnection,help}.cpp}: let users
      control libssh debugging via the new parameters --libssh-debug and
      --libssh-packetlog. Properly document the new switches and their
      implications.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: drop DEBUG preprocessor conditional blocks.
      We have never actually disabled it and x2goDebug () will not write out
      anything if debugging has not been requested, so we already have a soft
      condition check for every x2goDebug () call.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: do not use std::array since that's a C++11 feature,
      just live with plain C arrays for now.
    - x2goclient.pro: fix libssh_threads logic again. Ubuntu Bionic/18.04
      ships a pre-release version of 0.8.0, which is tagged as that version,
      but really based upon 0.7.x and still has/needs a libssh_threads
      library. Big "Wat?" to you, Canonical. Fixes: #1320.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: fix array length calculation.
    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.70 to 0.71. Fixes quite a list of issues
      discovered through the EU-funded bug bounty programme. Not all are
      relevant to X2Go Client.
    - Windows: upgrade bundled VcXsrv to 1.20.1.4.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: use info (protocol) log level with
      --libssh-debug and debug (packet) log level with --libssh-packetlog.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: fix compiler warning due to mismatching
      argument with older libssh versions.
    - Makefile: clear out LDFLAGS, add new (cleared) LIBS variable and pass
      down as QMAKE_LIBS. The previous behavior was leading to compile
      failures on arm64 machines (albeit only old distro versions,
      apparently), because QMAKE_LFLAGS is being put on the command line
      *before* the actual object files to be included/linked, which is an
      error for system libraries. Builds will still fail after this commit,
      but that's okay.
    - x2goclient.pro: add libraries that we always want to use on Linux
      correctly to LIBS and use a bigger catch clause. That should work much
      better, since linux-g++ and linux-g++-64 are x86-specific, while there
      are way more potentially useful targets like linux-aarch64-gnu-g++,
      clang, llvm, icc etc.
    - x2goclient.pro: while a linux scope seems to work fine with Qt5, Qt4
      doesn't recognize that, so add another linux-* catch.
    - Windows: add support for x3270-fonts, including adding a pretty nasty
      but necessary fonts.* file regeneration hook.
    - {x2goclient,help,onmainwindow}.cpp: implement new
      --bypass-cleanup-helper parameter.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix building with Qt 4.6, currently the latest
      version available in EPEL 6.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: unbreak builds by fixing syntax error.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: also unbreak old EPEL 6 builds.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add (and prefer) non-compat-symlink scp server
      location for 64-bit-based Gentoo distros (17.1+ profiles). Fixes:
      #1393.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: replace changed source strings, no
      retranslations required.
    - src/httpbrokerclient.cpp: do not leak password length in debug output
      either.
    - src/sessionwidget.cpp: stop parsing proxy address as "host:port: if the
      address contains a colon. Fixes: #1418. We don't do this for the
      "normal" host address and this behavior clashes with IPv6 addresses. We
      COULD, theoretically, keep it, but that would require writing an
      arbitrary address parser. Too much effort for little gain.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: also remove proxy "host:port" parsing at connect
      time. Fixes: #1418.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PulseAudio 13.0 since it's now available
      in MacPorts.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: disable "left click" action on OS X/macOS. This
      platform always gets a left click event, even when right clicked. May
      sound weird first, but this behavior is consistent between all
      applications - tray icons can be clicked via either button and will
      always trigger a context menu. Let X2Go Client behave the same way.
    - src/sshprocess.cpp: strip ~/, ~user{,/}, ${HOME}{,/} and $HOME{,/} from
      destination paths in scp mode. Fixes: #1428. This was already necessary
      for pascp (PuTTY-based Windows solution for Kerberos support), but newer
      libssh versions with the CVE-2019-14889 also interpret paths as literal
      strings.
    - src/SVGFrame.cpp: simplify implementation a lot. Only paint data onto
      the widget in the paintEvent () function. Drop setting a palette based
      upon the rendered SVG image, which has been very wrong to do from the
      beginning and only lead to visual glitches. Correctly repaint
      single-frame SVG files.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: work around lupdate warning by adding
      another block in the #else preprocessor branch.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: update translation files.
    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.71 to 0.73. Fixes another round of issues
      discovered through the EU-funded bug bounty programme and other security
      problems.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: stop PulseAudio from spamming logs after a client
      disconnects. Fixes: #1425. Patch based on one submitted by Ville
      Salmela.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: instead of searching for "sftp-binary", try to
      look for "sftp-server" in the Qt 5.x code path. Luckily this only
      affects cases where we bundle sftp-server (which we don't) or where
      sftp-server is actually part of $PATH (which it usually shouldn't be).
    - Windows: upgrade bundled VcXsrv to 1.20.6.0.
    - Windows: upgrade PulseAudio from 7.1 to 13.0.
    - Windows: remove libz. Was previously used by libzip, which has not been
      shipped for quite some time.
    - Windows: Update Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.2n to 1.0.2u. Implicit.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.7.4 to 0.9.3 (while maintaining Pageant
      support). Drop libssh_threads library not provided (or used) any longer.
    - x2goclient.pro: update comment mentioning that libssh does not provide
      pkgconfig files on non-UNIX/Windows platforms any longer and drop
      libssh_thread linkage.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nl.ts: add missing singular form to a multi-form
      entry.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_cs.ts: fix up whitespace and mark actually finished
      translation string as such, also removing my previous comment.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: fix up whitespace and typos.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_de.ts: better translate UNIX cleanup helper and fix
      "X2Go Client" as "X2GoClient" globally.
    - misc: pre-release copyright update.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: update in-code copyright notice.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: update copyright notice in about dialog
      manually.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add comment for translators encouraging them to
      add themselves to copyright notice.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: update after source code changes and comment
      addition.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: mark copyright translation string as
      unfinished for already translated languages (but Finnish) to alert
      translators of the new comment.
    - man/man1/x2goclient.1: pre-release date update.
  * debian/control:
    + Add build-depend on pkg-config.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    + Build-depend on pkg-config.
    + EPEL packages need to depend upon pkgconfig for now, not pkg-config.
    + Pull in redhat-rpm-config manually. This should probably be done by
      something else, like... gcc or qmake or qt(4)-dev, but it isn't.
    + Try to ignore gettext-tools-mini on *SuSE to force installation of the
      new/renamed gettext-runtime-mini package.
    + It's %endif, not %fi.
    + Revert the gettext-tools-mini change, was caused by an outdated
      obs-build version.

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.2.2):
    - Add support for Nix OS for common_sftp_dirs's hard-coded
      sftp-server paths.
    - src/sessionwidget.cpp: Rename shadowing sessiontype to 'X2Go/X11 Desktop
      Sharing'.
    - man/man1/x2goclient.1: Add explanation for the --broker-name option.
    - res/resources.qrc: Add Czech translation file.
    - Update qt_<lang>.qm files from Qt5 v5.11.2.
    - Rename radion button lables for xfreerdp options' style.
  * debian/control:
    + In x2goclient R, prefer freerdp2-x11 over rdesktop over freerdp-x11
      (which is broken these days anyway).
    + In x2goclient D, add x2gokdriveclient.
    + In x2goclient D, add hello as an alternative to x2gokdriveclient. Works
      around non-available x2gokdriveclient on Debian jessie.

  * New upstream release (4.1.2.2):
    - Add new translation: Czech.
    - Second update round of Czech translation + enable it in x2goclient.pro.

  [ Ulrich Sibiller ]
  * New upstream release (4.1.2.2):
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: close channel on failure in checkLogin ().
    - src/sshmasterconnection.{cpp,h}: skip checkLogin() if hostname starts
      with "!". Some special ssh proxies will not allow arbitrary commands.
      checkLogin() will break these sessions because it tries to run the echo
      command on the proxy. By specifying a "!" as the first character of the
      (proxy) hostname you can instruct x2goclient ot skip the checkLogin()
      call altogether. Note that this will break proxies that require you to
      change you password or some other type of interaction. As this is added
      to SshMasterConnection it is also valid to specify that for the server
      hostname although this is not very useful.

  * New upstream version (4.1.2.0):
    - misc: update version to 4.1.2.0.
    - res/img/svg: add new lxqt.svg icon file (really helix.svg).
    - res/img/icons/*x*: add new rasterized lxqt.png files in different sizes.
    - res/qresources.qrc: add new lxqt files.
    - src/{onmainwindow.cpp,session{button,widget}.{cpp,h}}: add support for
      LXQt. Fixes: #1263.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: stop libssh/OpenSSL from querying for a
      passphrase if started with a controlling terminal.
    - x2goclient.pro: remove plugin references.
    - misc: change http:// to https:// where appropriate, but in actual code
      and translation files for now.
    - Makefile: remove plugin references.
    - Makefile: remove x2goclient_*.qm files in clean rule.
    - x2gobrowserplugin-2.4_1/: remove.

      references.
    - src/editconnectiondialog.cpp: do not connect signals to slots that do
      not exist on non-Linux platforms.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add -nopn parameter to VcXsrv startup options,
      making the binary fail if it wasn't able to bind the requested port on
      all addresses.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: print out current DISPLAY value in debug log while
      starting X.Org Server on Windows.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: don't error out directly if starting the X.Org
      Server failed on Windows. Instead, try starting it three times, each
      time with a higher DISPLAY offset. On busy client machines, several
      clients raced for the sockets previously and often failed to start. Also
      check if the server binary actually is still alive before doing the TCP
      connection checks. A dead server won't be able to listen on a socket in
      the first place.
    - {src/{onmainwindow.{cpp,h},help.cpp},man/man1/x2goclient.1}: add new
      option --xserver-start-limit, replacing the formerly hardcoded limit of
      three tries.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: fix compile error on Windows - use std::size_t
      instead of std::ssize_t, treat zero as infinity value while parsing
      option value.

    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: another compile error/typo fix.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: let client recognize new --xserver-start-limit
      param correctly.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add -silent-dup-error parameter to VcXsrv startup
      options, forcing it to silently fail without showing a dialog and thus
      keeping the process running.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: re-add periodic xmodmap keyboard sync for OS
      X/macOS platforms. Was dropped some time ago by accident.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error on OS X/macOS.
    - copy-deps-win32.bat: update to 20160121-4 Cygwin bundle, shipping with
      chgrp.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix user-facing error messages in Windows X.Org
      Server startup functions.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: use QByteArray's constData () instead of data (),
      since we'll never modify the data anyway.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: hook-in chgrp for ~/.x2go/etc on Windows platforms
      to work around a Cygwin permissions bug. Fixes: #1156.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: QProcess:nullDevice () is only available on Qt

      exit code indicates a failure.

      chgrp.
    - copy-deps-win32.bat: update to 20180615-1 Cygwin bundle, shipping with
      a further modified OpenSSH Server version at 7.7p1-1-x2go1 and without
      chgrp.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: disable private host key permissions check in
      OpenSSH Server on Windows. Fixes: #1156.

x2goclient (4.1.1.1-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.1.1):
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: print out PA --version output as a debug message.
    - macbuild.sh: also bundle xauth binary as nxauth binary.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PulseAudio 11.1 since it's now available
      in MacPorts.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't ask for private key passphrase if
      auto-login merely failed due to the server denying the public key.
      Fixes: #1122.
    - src/{httpbrokerclient,onmainwindow,sshmasterconnection}.{cpp,h}:
      introduce new passphrase_type enum and replace the old verificationCode
      boolean value with that. Allows using more messages, including a new one
      for plain password prompts. Adapt usage accordingly. The implementation
      is ugly, but there's no good way around that (short of using C++11
      features). The enum would really logically belong to ONMainWindow, but
      since we also have to use it in SshMasterConnection, that may not
      include onmainwindow.h to avoid a circular dependency, it has to be
      part of SshMasterConnection for now.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: query for password if it wasn't already
      provided. Fixes: #1122. This usually happens if auto-login is enabled,
      which bypasses the password prompt. If auto-login fails, authentication
      normally continues via challenge auth or plain passwords, but since
      users had no chance to input a password, such authentication will always
      fail. Give users a way to enter passwords, in case the auto-login
      failed.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: finally include version information in debug
      output.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: apply last change to translation files
      directly.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: error out with a useful error message in
      case no password has been provided when doing password authentication.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't output an empty error message if
      password authencation has been requested but the server does not support
      this mechanism. Fixes: #408.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: wrap user name for client-side mounts in quotes.
      Fixes: #559. Will fail with user names that contain quotes, but oh
      well...
    - {example/x2goclient-cli,src/onmainwindow.cpp}: remove hopefully obsolete
      HOSTNAME exporting into environment.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: remove client-side LD_LIBRARY_PATH meddling.
      Nothing of value is in that directory and nxproxy hasn't needed that for
      years.
    - src/settingswidgets.cpp: don't incorrectly enable whole display settings
      in single display setups. Let debugging mode override this behavior,
      though.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: pass X2GO_RANDR_XINERAMA=[yes,no] to
      x2gostartagent as an environment variable based upon the xinerama
      session setting. Has no effect when connecting to older X2Go Server
      versions and handles startup correctly with X2Go Server 4.1.0.0.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix another leaked X2goSettings object.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: rename xinerama env variable on session startup to
      X2GO_XINERAMA in accordance with server changes.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: supply xinerama option as another parameter to
      x2goresume-session on session resume.
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: make button non-sensitive in bottom right part if
      it's editable. Fixes: #1214.
    - {src/{help.cpp,onmainwindow.{cpp,h}},man/man1/x2goclient.1}: reformat,
      whitespace fixes, split out close button slot in a separate function.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: let close button be a member variable.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: disable and enable close button during and after
      connection startup.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: initialize directRDP to false to be able to call
      slotSuspendSessFromSt () even if no session has previously been started.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: only initialize directRDP variable if platform is
      Linux. Fixes compile failures on Windows and OS X.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: always create close button, but either hide or
      show it based upon whether --closebt was provided or not.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: revert 3060183a78d8b6bd81bec9968c985c38bfd1e5c2.
      Being able to suspend sessions via the close button is complex and
      unnecessary, since in thinclient mode, for which this feature is
      useful, users will not be able to see the client window while a session
      is executing, due to it running in full screen mode.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: always enable close button, let it log out from a
      broker if already authenticated or close the client on click. Fixes:
      #1209.
    - man/man1/x2goclient.1: clarify what the close button now does. It either
      lets the user re-login to the broker or closes the client.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: correctly initialize brokerAuthentication member
      of ConfigFile struct.
    - {res/{img/png/close-button.png,resources.qrc},
       src/{{onmainwindow,httpbrokerclient}.{cpp,h},help.cpp},
       man/man1/x2goclient.1}: rename close button to broker logout button.
      Reimplement the way it is shown - disable it upon startup and only
      enable it after successful broker authentication.
    - man/man1/x2goclient.1: add missing escape signs before dash/minus
      characters.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.1.1):
    - Change echo mode for user input in InteractionDialog.

  [ Walid Moghrabi ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.1.1):
    - {res/img/png/,res/resources.qrc}: add close-button.png file.
    - {src/{help.cpp,onmainwindow.{cpp,h}},man/man1/x2goclient.1}: add new
      option --closebt. Fixes: #1227. Adds a close button in the top-left
      client corner (maybe next to the halt button) that currently just
      terminates the client.

x2goclient (4.1.1.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.1.0):
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: use ssh_channel_listen_forward () instead
      of ssh_forward_listen () for newer libssh versions. Fixes: #870.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: with libssh 0.6.0 and newer, get the public
      key via ssh_get_server_publickey () (0.8.0 and higher) or
      ssh_get_publickey () (0.7.x and lower) and its hash via
      ssh_get_publickey_hash () instead of using the deprecated
      ssh_get_pubkey_hash () function. Additionally, replace free () with the
      more appropriate ssh_string_free_char () function after using
      ssh_get_hexa (). This will break on very old systems with a hopelessly
      outdated libssh version, but we do not care about these systems in the
      first place.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace string_free () with its successor
      ssh_string_free (). Will break on ancient systems, but we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_new () function
      with ssh_channel_new (). Might break on ancient systems, but we don't
      care. Also, add error handling in case ssh_channel_new () failed...
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_open_forward ()
      function with ssh_channel_open_forward (). Might break on ancient
      systems, but we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_open_session ()
      function with ssh_channel_open_session (). Might break on ancient
      systems, but we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_request_exec ()
      function with ssh_channel_request_exec (). Might break on ancient
      systems, but we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_poll () function
      with ssh_channel_poll (). Might break on ancient systems, but we don't
      care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_read () function
      with ssh_channel_read (). Might break on ancient systems, but we don't
      care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_is_eof ()
      function with ssh_channel_is_eof (). Might break on ancient systems, but
      we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_write ()
      function with ssh_channel_write (). Might break on ancient systems, but
      we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_send_eof ()
      function with ssh_channel_send_eof (). Might break on ancient systems,
      but we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_close ()
      function with ssh_channel_close (). Might break on ancient systems, but
      we don't care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: replace deprecated channel_free () function
      with ssh_channel_free (). Might break on ancient systems, but we don't
      care.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: use QString::arg () to insert function name
      and thus deduplicate error translation messages. Also re-add the full
      stop sign and remove it when needed for x2goDebug.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: fix up some debug strings.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: port more occurrences of "QString to C
      string" akin to 1b21d75f2c10609f3586f5b5e0b4ceb7fca83fdd.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: enable parsing of ~/.ssh/config.
      Fixes: #1121. Shorthands as host names and other bells and whistles like
      inferred port or user name values are now supported.
    - src/{onmainwindow,httpbrokerclient}.cpp: fix up error/warning message
      displayed when the server-specified key is unknown, but we have another
      key type stored already.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix up a debug string. Qt drops a space where I'd
      like to have one and inserts a space where I'd like none, so work around
      that fancifully.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: libssh < 0.6.0 does not have the
      ssh_options_get () API, but instead expects users to pull out
      information directly from the ssh_session structure. This fixes compile
      issues on systems with older libssh versions.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: turns out libssh < 0.6.0 doesn't support
      fetching the host, port and username parameters at all. We're in the
      clear for non-SSH-proxied connections and can use config file parsing,
      but have to disable config file parsing in the proxy settings, as
      there's no way to query the remote endpoint information. As a result we
      will be unable to open a new socket to the remote endpoint and proxying
      will fail badly.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: ensure that add_to_path () also processes the first
      value passed. Fixes startup problems in MacPorts. Fixes: #1093.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_et.ts: various fixups for the Estonian translation
      file.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: go the extra mile and fix up translation files
      manually after the "anothertype" fix in
      8e503d89ee2d03a313c3deff11f0516fce503022.
    - {src/{onmainwindow,httpbrokerclient}.cpp,res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts}: fix
      another occurrence of a string missing a space separator between words
      and update translation files.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: don't duplicate depth warning message needlessly,
      use correct plural forms in translations and split string up in a
      translation-friendly form. I'll leave translators to handle this beast,
      as languages are unique in the number of plural forms and the like.
    - {src/printdialog.cpp,res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts}: drop spurious left-over
      parenthesis in warning message and adapt translations.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: make the "not loading translator" message
      non-translatable, as it doesn't make a lot of sense to actually
      translate it.
    - {src/{configdialog,x2goutils}.cpp,res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts}: change
      XQuartz project homepage references, adapt translations.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: make get_* () functions const.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: make is_server_running () const.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add new pulse_version_valid_ boolean class
      member variable, set it correctly and use it whenever the version is
      accessed.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: make fetch_pulseaudio_version () more resilient.
      Instead of aborting hard when the version number could not be detected,
      break out of the loops only. We can make stuff work, even if the version
      is unknown. Or just continue without PA support as such.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add show_startup_warning () for both PA server
      and (debug) startup sound playback.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: check server_binary_ before using it and jump over
      code that assumes the PA server binary to be available.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: don't fail hard on OS X if the PA server binary
      could not be found in the constructor. We can live without PA and will
      show a warning message to the user later on when PA is supposed to be
      started.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: deduplicate warning/error messages - make use of
      show_startup_warning (). This does imply changes to the translation
      files, coming up next.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: regenerate translation files and fix up some
      SSH and PulseManager messages manually, where possible.
    - src/x2ogutils.h: guard UNUSED macro definition.
    - {macbuild.sh,src/{x2goutils.h,{pulsemanager,onmainwindow}.cpp},
       x2goclient.pro}: make MacPorts prefix selectable at compile time. Much
      cleaner for downstream package maintainers (like, for instance, MacPorts
      itself.)
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_fi.ts: remove outdated comment.
    - src/sshprocess.cpp: bind direct tunnel socket to localhost instead of
      any address. Fixes: #31.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: check for sessionExplorer->getLastSession() to be
      valid in all places but obvious ones. Fixes: #499.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: use new PKI-based libssh API for public key
      authentication for libssh 0.6.0 and higher. Fixes: #1119.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: add YubiKey challenge auth prompt.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: fix compile errors on pre-libssh-0.6.0
      systems and add a TOCTU-race check to see if the file exists prior to
      calling privatekey_from_file () on such systems. Additionally fix a type
      issue.
    - macbuild.sh: fix long-standing issue that made the DMG bundle contain a
      symlink made up of only a space to /Applications.
    - res/img/icons/dmg: add new image disk.svg, used as the basis for the new
      OS X DMG bundle icon.
    - res/img/icons/dmg: add new disk-drive-and-x2goclient icon for use as the
      volume icon of the OS X DMG bundle.
    - macbuild.sh: use the new volume icon that actually also looks like a
      disk drive. Fixes: #930.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: typo fix only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: do not automatically set login user name to
      current system user if empty. Unbreaks default user name fetching via
      libssh. Might break some use cases (especially RDP, XDMCP).
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: revert change bypassing the UNIX cleanup helper.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: revert old behavior and select user name field
      after a session has been suspended/terminated if user name was not
      provided. Do not insert an user name, though, but leave it to
      autodetection by default.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: fix SSH-proxied connections with port
      numbers of zero.
      In order to authenticate the remote server, SSH-proxied connections must
      be reset to their remote host and port values after connecting via the
      SSH tunnel. If the original port value was zero, setting it was skipped,
      leading to connections like $REMOTE_HOST:$PROXY_PORT, which is certainly
      wrong. Fetch the inferred port value and set this instead, fixing this
      issue.
    - Makefile: add new QMAKE_OPTS variable so that packagers can pass
      additional options to qmake directly.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: typo fix in log message only.
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't leak ssh_session data, free it once
      we're done with it.
    - Makefile: qmake seems to act weird if QMAKE_C(XX)FLAGS starts with a
      space followed by additional non-whitespace characters. Refactor the
      variables a bit to work around this issue.
    - Makefile: turns out the only somewhat portable way to do something like
      this is via shell hackery.
    - Makefile: reset to the original state and make sure that we don't pass
      CXXFLAGS on to the actual build process to not override the values
      generated by qmake.
    - Makefile: the only way to prevent variables on the command line to be
      passed down seems to be to remove them from MAKEOVERRIDES.
      .MAKEOVERRIDES is the FreeBSD-make-equivalent variable. MAKEFLAGS has no
      effect on this behavior, so removing it again.
    - Makefile: add comment explaining why we need to do this in the first
      place and why it's so complicated.
    - src/sshmasterconnection: ignore "garbage", but require at least one line
      to start with a known challenge auth prompt. Fixes: #966.
    - x2goclient.pro: add libssh_threads library. We need this since X2Go
      Client is multi-threaded.
    - copy-deps-win32.bat: also copy libssh_threads.dll to go with the
      previous change.
    - src/{onmainwindow,sshmasterconnection}.{cpp,h}: correctly initialize and
      finalize libssh. We ought to do both only once - in our main thread.
      Previously, we initialized libssh in a new thread, which might be
      problematic.
    - src/sessionexplorer.cpp: open the correct tab when editing a session
      from the exports menu.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: try to workaround window placement if settings
      contain a (newly) invalid position (e.g., a position that refers to a
      disconnected display.)
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: try to find a display that can hold the window's
      position fetched from the sizes settings. Use the default if none could
      be found.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix up main window position check; use
      QRect.intersects ().
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: rename shutdownState to shutdown_state_,
      reorder in initializer list.
    - res/i18n/: regenerate translations.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_es.ts: fixup Spanish translation file.

      "x2go" part from an Estonian translation message.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_sv.ts: minor whitespace fixup.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: apply "XMDCP" -> "XDMCP" fix manually to
      translation files.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: remove obsolete comments (leading to
      problems when regenerating translation files.)
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nl.ts: remove obsolete comments (leading to problems
      when regenerating translation files.)
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_*.ts: regenerate translations.

    - Add session config file option "sshproxysamekey". With this option
      client will use for proxy authentication same key as for X2Go server.
      This is important in first case for broker users, where key can be
      generated "on the fly". Maybe it makes sence to add this option in UI
      and command line later.
    - Correct negative display coordinates for FS sessions.

x2goclient (4.1.0.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: replace drop down menu button on session buttons
      with a more prominent, bigger settings gear icon. Requested for
      visibility.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add debug statements to createRSAKey () regarding
      the host pub key locations on OS X.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix error message string in
      printSshDError_noHostPubKey ().
    - src/sshmasterconnection.cpp: add SecurID prompt to challenge auth code
      prompts.
    - src/sharewidget.cpp: fix compile on UNIX-like platforms by defaulting to
      ISO-8859-1 not just on Linux but also other platforms. Fixes: #1124.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: don't try to wrap absolute paths as legacy resource
      URIs in wrap_legacy_resource_URIs (). Fixes: #910.
    - {res/img/svg/,res/resources.qrc}: add new file hamburger.svg, a
      custom-created hamburger icon.
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: replace drop down menu button on session buttons
      again with the custom-created hamburger icon. Also fix positioning
      issues in mini mode.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add new function images_resource_path (),
      similar to iconsPath () but without explicitly referring to icons.
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: we cannot use ".." in resource paths to move up
      one level, so use images_resource_path () instead and hope that we
      finally get a yummy hamburger.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: let iconsPath () take a const-reference
      instead of an object and make it a const member function.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: let images_resource_path () take a new,
      optional "base" parameter, that might be empty and is put in-between the
      fixed resource path string and the filename parameter.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: use images_resource_path () in iconsPath ().
    - src/sessionbutton.cpp: instead of using the hamburger.svg file directly,
      render it to a raster image and use this Pixmap as the icon file -
      otherwise the icon will not show up. Also change the icon size back to
      16x16 px, that's big enough.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: remove left-over debug test message.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}}: add unixhelper stub.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: implement cleanup program for process group.
    - x2goclient.cpp: wrap X2Go Client main function and use that.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add fork_helper() function to start up the UNIX cleanup
      helper.
    - x2goclient.cpp: use setsid() on UNIX to become session and process group
      leader. If that fails, fork, terminate the parent and execute setsid()
      in the child process. Use fork_helper() to start the UNIX cleanup helper
      in a child process and continue with the main application in the parent.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add myself to copyright header.
    - x2goclient.cpp: add legacy <sys/types.h> header needed for old operating
      systems.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix std::edit -> std::exit typo.
    - unixhelper.{h,cpp}: also include <QtCore/qglobal.h> to have Q_OS_UNIX
      defined on UNIX-based platforms. Move guards around.
    - unixhelper.h: forgot to declare type of unix_cleanup() function.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.cpp}: unixhelper should really be a
      (module) namespace, not a class.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: add documentation/comments.
    - x2goclient.cpp: return return value of unixhelper::unix_cleanup().
    - unixhelper.cpp: kill process group on error.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: implement signal unblocking in
      unixhelper::unix_cleanup(). Update documentation.
    - unixhelper.cpp: port from std::signal() to sigaction(). Handle errors.
    - x2goclient.cpp: clean up. We don't care if setsid() fails or succeeds
      and we certainly do not need to fork to force it to succeed. Whether we
      are a process group leader already or become one doesn't matter, if the
      end result is that we are process group leader.
    - x2goclient.cpp: don't start the UNIX cleanup helper process right after
      forking, but introduce a new command line option --unixhelper and
      re-execute the main binary with this new option to indicate that the
      UNIX cleanup helper tool is requested. It is necessary to call exec()
      after fork on virtually all operating system, especially on OS X.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix compile problems introduced with the last commit.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix string comparison.
    - x2goclient.cpp: create new argv array on the heap instead of on the
      stack. Stack data will be invalid once the function goes out of scope
      (which is what execv is doing.)
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: raise sleeping time to two seconds and grace period
      to 10 seconds.
    - {unixhelper.{cpp,h},x2goclient.cpp}: switch main cleanup handling to
      parent PID polling.
    - unixhelper.{cpp,h}: ignore SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGPIPE, SIGQUIT, SIGUSR1
      and SIGUSR2.
    - x2goclient.cpp: fix failing exec() call for the UNIX helper utility:
      correctly terminate arguments vector.
    - {appdialog,configwidget,onmainwindow,unixhelper}.cpp: fix some compile
      warnings with GCC. Fix a few whitespace issues.
    - appdialog.cpp: initialize parent in default case. Another GCC compile
      warning fix.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly use ~/.x2go/.ssh as ssh directory when
      starting sshd in user mode. Put the authorized_keys file in there. Check
      and set correct permissions for both the directory and authorized_keys
      file. Generalize some Windows-specific sections by using QDir and QFile.
    - compat.{cpp,h}: new files. Implements strndup on OS X 10.6 and below.
      Add to x2goclient.cpp, x2goclient.pro and x2goclient.pro.maemo.
    - compat.{cpp,h}: remove inline keyword, because function is not defined
      in header file.
    - compat.h: include QtCore/qglobal.h for Q_OS_... macros.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: new class for PulseAudio management.
    - x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}: reference new pulsemanager.{cpp,h} files.
    - macbuild.sh: add new MACPORTS_PREFIX detection/variable.
    - macbuild.sh: add new dependency_error() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new lazy_canonical_path() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new get_nesting_level() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: add new repeat_str() helper function.
    - macbuild.sh: refactor nxproxy detection to use MACPORTS_PREFIX.
    - macbuild.sh: add EXE_DIR and FRAMEWORKS_DIR internal variables. Create
      directories based on that. Use them when bundling.
    - macbuild.sh: define PulseAudio libraries and binaries to be later
      copied. Discover them using MACPORTS_PREFIX. Error out if any component
      was not found.
    - macbuild.sh: copy PulseAudio libraries and binaries.
    - macbuild.sh: add phase output for bundling nxproxy.
    - macbuild.sh: add work-in-progress PulseAudio bundling. Needs to be ripped
      apart and be redone, because dylibbundler is not smart enough to handle
      our case.
    - macbuild.sh: add Linux library file name scheme regex as a precaution.
    - macbuild.sh: directories are "executable", so the first check must
      explicitly include a check for the argument being not a directory.
    - macbuild.sh: add some more debugging output.
    - macbuild.sh: remove libpulse and libpulsecore from libraries to be
      bundled, as something else will bundle them anyway.
    - macbuild.sh: use while-read-loop and find to actually recurse through
      directories.
    - macbuild.sh: check current file name against regex, not a (now) full
      path.
    - macbuild.sh: add the correct file path to the library bundling array.
    - macbuild.sh: when actually bundling libraries, use @executable_path
      instead of @loader_path. Will need testing.
    - macbuild.sh: fix echo call to also show the intermediate lib dir, not
      just the library file name. Helps debugging.
    - macbuild.sh: also install libraries into staging area with intermediate
      library path. Putting everything into a single place is a stupid idea.
    - deduplicate.sh: add new, more or less Proof of Concept, and Work in
      Progress file deduplication script.
    - deduplicate.sh: add duplicates-to-real mapping.
    - deduplicate.sh: add missed local variable declaration.
    - deduplicate.sh: new function for parsing otool's output and printing
      library dependencies if no error occurred.
    - deduplicate.sh: non-functional: change WARNING to ERROR in error
      messages.
    - deduplicate.sh: add first skeleton for library dependency rewriting of
      deleted duplicates.
    - deduplicate.sh: correctly unset an array element.
    - deduplicate.sh: change range-based for loops to "${!arr[@]}" to handle
      "sparse" arrays correctly.
    - deduplicate.sh: quote "${arr[@]}" correctly to not suddenly force word
      splitting.
    - deduplicate.sh: fix parse_otool_output: we want to return failure only
      iff any of the strings are present in otool's output and actually handle
      the failure string *ARRAY* correctly as that.
    - deduplicate.sh: change exit to return in parse_otool_output.
    - deduplicate.sh: record crafted "library path" values in duplicates
      replacement to_files array.
    - deduplicate.sh: debug parse_otool_output fiercely for the time being.
    - deduplicate.sh: prevent word splitting when parsing otool's output. We
      want the raw bits.
    - deduplicate.sh: switch to range-based for loop in fixup section for
      duplicate array walking as we need to access the same element index in
      the replacement array.
    - deduplicate.sh: add more useful information in fixup section's error
      message.
    - deduplicate.sh: unstub fixup section.
    - deduplicate.sh: parse_otool_output: jump over first matching entry,
      which is - hopefully - the id line.
    - deduplicate.sh: actually include file name in install_name_tool pseudo
      output.
    - deduplicate.sh: save dependency format base string as a readonly
      variable and use that instead of repeating a fixed string.
    - deduplicate.sh: copy lazy_canonical_path from macbuild.sh for now.
      deduplicate.sh will eventually be merged into macbuild.sh anyway.
    - deduplicate.sh: more temporary debugging output in fixup section.
    - deduplicate.sh: surprisingly, it turned out that only checking the
      duplicate's basename against the current dependency's basename is not
      good enough. Actually construct "the real dependency-format duplicate
      string" and check it against "the real dependency". Even this is still
      not good enough as it needs a bit cleanup - coming up next.
    - deduplicate.sh: cleanup as announced in the last commit - using
      lazy_canonical_path.
    - deduplicate.sh: remove a bit of noisy debug output, but turn on
      parse_otool_output debugging.
    - deduplicate.sh: fix wrong return value capture. We want to check the
      return value of the executed function/command, not that of "typeset".
    - deduplicate.sh: add WARNING to status message.
    - deduplicate.sh: remove some noisy debug output.
    - macbuild.sh: replace tabs with two spaces. No functional changes.
    - deduplicate.sh: replace tabs with two spaces. No functional changes.
    - macbuild.sh: merge deduplicate.sh content in. Also enable the
      functionality "for real", not just as a dry-run.
    - macbuild.sh: spelling fix.
    - macbuild.sh: more more debug messages and a whitespace change.
    - macbuild.sh: fix removal of base prefix in deduplication if base prefix
      ends in a slash.
    - macbuild.sh: copy "special" files, so that they can be removed later on.
    - macbuild.sh: rewrite ID line detection algorithm. Modules don't seem to
      be needing one, so skipping the first dependency line incidentally skips
      a "real" dependency for modules.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: use name and underscore for member variables, not
      underscore and name.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: minor non-behavior changing fixes.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: reformat only.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: use initializer list for constructor.

    - pulsemanager.cpp: add cleanup support to on_pulse_finished ().
    - pulsemanager.cpp: add Windows stuff to initial env in constructor.

      common functionality.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: let start_osx () use start_generic ().
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: implement start_win () as part of Windows
      functionality.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: also load module-esound-protocol-tcp module.

    - pulsemanager.cpp: make generate_client_config () Windows-compatible.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: only play startup sound if DEBUG macro is defined.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: make startup sound playing via
      slot_play_startup_sound () Windows-compatible.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: typo fix in variable name server_working_dir_.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: find_port () actually returns a value, fix
      declaration accordingly.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: fix compile errors in find_port () by renaming the ret
      or port variable to search_port.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: fix another compile error due to typo'd versions of
      generate_server_config () and generate_client_config ().
    - pulsemanager.cpp: another typo fix: findPort -> find_port.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: reorder member variables in initialization list.
      Compile warning fix.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: add "dummy" start_linux () function.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: generate platform-dependent values for member
      variables server_working_dir_ and server_binary_ in constructor. We need
      them right away.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: new member function fetch_pulseaudio_version ()
      with first skeleton. Call it in the constructor.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: re-initialize buffer string on each run while getting
      CWD on Linux.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: fix some error messages by removing redundant
      newlines.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: some older PA versions used the major, minor and
      micro numbering scheme together with a descriptive string. Add new
      member variables for this and initialize them correctly.
    - pulsemanager.h: reformat a bit by adding newlines and moving lines in a
      (hopefully) logical fashion.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: add algorithm for actually extracting PA version
      number.
    - pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: only allow changing PA or ESD ports when server is
      not currently running.

      as getters and setters.
    - pulsemanager.cpp: reorder member variables in initializer list.

      just need to construct a new object.
    - macbuild.sh: PulseAudio has been updated to version 8.0. Reflect this.
    - macbuild.sh: libpulsecore.dylib also resides in the "private" pulseaudio
      subdirectory now, adding it to "special files workaround".
    - pulsemanager.cpp: remove config.pa while doing post-exit cleanups.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add get_pulse_dir () for fetching the
      (OS-dependent) PulseAudio config and cookie directory.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: replace hardcoded modules paths with dynamic ones
      depending on the detected PA version.

      PulseManager.)
    - src/configdialog.cpp: whitespace only.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: hook PulseManager in - for both OS X and
      Windows.

    - src/pulsemanager.h: move x2gologdebug.h inclusion into implementation
      file.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: output PA stdout/stderr via x2goDebug, not plainly
      to stdout.
    - src/configdialog.cpp: fix compile error by removing obsolete (and now
      faulty) line for removed restart message.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile errors due to misspelled function
      names.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: let start () act as a wrapper and do nothing if
      the PA server is already running.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error due to misuse of #ifdef.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: convert QDir object to QString for further
      processing.

      and always use it, no matter whether server is up already or not.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix compile error due to typo.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: hide Windows-only code behind #ifdefs. Otherwise
      we'll get compile failures on non-Windows platforms.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: add debugging setter and private variable.
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: port to new debugging feature.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: port to new debugging feature of PulseManager.
    - src/pulsemanager.h: fix compile error due to mismatching function
      declaration for set_debug ().
    - res/sound: add startup.wav sound to be played back when starting the PA
      daemon in debug mode.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: don't time out while trying to start PA or paplay.
      "Handle" errors by printing out debug messages.
    - macbuild.sh: add support for copying resource files. Currently only used
      for startup.wav.
    - res: rename "sound" to "audio".
    - macbuild.sh: fix copying of resource files.

    - macbuild.sh: don't error out while executing parse_otool_output ().
    - macbuild.sh: save return value of parse_otool_output (). Otherwise we'll
      fetch the return value of "set", which is not really what we need.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix typo in fetch_pulseaudio_version (). Read
      standard output from temporary process, not our "main" server process
      (which at this point is not even started yet.)
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: don't overwrite the temporary string variable for
      the current line with what was supposed to hold new data in
      fetch_pulseaudio_version ().
    - src/pulsemanager.{cpp,h}: rename on_pulse_finished () to
      slot_on_pulse_finished (). Oops...
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: actually only play startup sound if debugging is
      enabled.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: don't insert stray newline into config.pa.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: insert PULSE_SERVER and PULSE_COOKIE variables
      into environment as used by PulseManager. Otherwise we won't be able to
      start binaries like paplay.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: don't remove PA config and log file in
      ~/.x2go/pulse on PA shutdown if debugging has been requested.
    - src/x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new function find_binary (). Searches for a
      specific binary in a colon-separated list of paths. Really just a compat
      function, as Qt 5 includes QStandardPaths::findExecutable ().
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: auto-detect PA binary in $PATH and MacPorts
      default prefix as well on OS X.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: add comments to Qt 4 code part.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: add reminder for Linux-implementation in
      slot_play_startup_sound ().
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: fix compile error.
    - src/pulsemanager.h: add new system_pulse_ variable to indicate that
      a system PA binary shall be used.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: correctly initialize and set system_pulse_ when
      required.
    - src/x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add application modality parameter to
      show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox () and its wrappers.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: add error message boxes throughout PulseManager.
      Don't just abort () the program.
    - src/x2goutils.h: fix compile error due to typo.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix compile error on Windows.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix startup when using the system-PA version.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix startup sound playback when using the
      system-PA version.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: add warning message boxes where appropriate.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: remove extraneous newlines from debug output.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: fix faulty logic in find_binary (): only reset the
      given path to CWD iff it's actually empty. Not the other way around.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: add some debug logging to find_binary ().
    - nsis/x2goclient.nsi: add startup.wav to installer package.
    - src/: new file windows_stdint.h for Windows-compatibility when using
      std::(u)int*_t types. These are only available with GCC in C++11 mode on
      Windows for some reason.
    - src/pulsemanager.h: use windows_stdint.h header on Windows, cstdint
      otherwise.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: short out code parts unconditionally checking for
      the userSshd variable. We don't need it on Windows (and don't define it
      on purpose) because using an user-mode SSH daemon is implied there (for
      now.)
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: drop obsolete pulseVersionTest variable
      initialization in Windows-only code.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: drop obsolete pulseVersionIsLegacy variable
      initialization in Windows-only code.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add another pair of braces to in_addr-type
      variable initialization on Windows to silence compiler warning.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error on Windows after moving some
      code around.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: use correct C++ universal initializer for
      initializing in_addr-type variable, the C-style universal zero
      initializer won't cut it here.
    - src/pulsemanager.h: include accidentally omitted wapi.h header file.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: make PA version parsing function more generic and
      don't expect that a number is always terminated with a period or dash.
      Especially on Windows, with a PA version number of "6.0", this lead to
      errors. OS X was fine with its "8.0.0-something" version number, but the
      optional part at the end or even the micro version number could be
      missing any time.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: make sure that wherever we interface with non-Qt
      functions, paths are in native form (i.e., containing empty separators,
      instead of the "generic" slash UNIX-style separator.) Should fix a PA
      startup issue on Windows.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix PA version fetching on OS X again.
    - src/unixhelper.{cpp,h}: make argument of kill_pgroup () const.
    - src/unixhelper.h: style and general fixes within comments.
    - src/unixhelper.{cpp,h}: split off core functionality of kill_pgroup ()
      into a new function called real_kill_pgroup ().
    - src/unixhelper.{cpp,h}: rewrite kill_pgroup () to act as a wrapper
      around real_kill_pgroup (). Adjust comment. We need to do this so the
      cleanup process doesn't kill itself before all other processes in the
      process group are killed.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: remove unused variables.
    - src/unixhelper.cpp: code cleanup.
    - src/{unixhelper.cpp,x2goclient.cpp}: fix errno usage - save before use.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: document createRSAKey () because what it does is
      completely non-obvious.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add support for explicitly setting the private key
      bit size based on type and use values (currently) regarded as secure to
      generateHostKey ().
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: rename generateHostKey () to generateKey ()
      and add a boolean parameter with a default of false to request a public
      key. Change old invocations of generateHostKey () accordingly.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: refactor generateKey () a little bit to compact
      it.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: rewrite generateKey () function to actually
      also generate user keys. Now returns the private key file path (public
      key file path is trivially determined by appending ".pub" to that return
      value.) Change all locations referencing generateKey () to use the
      return value (if necessary) and remove dead code that was used to
      generate a user key manually previously.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add more error handling to generateKey () and fix
      up a broken error-handling section.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix up a few debug strings.
    - src/{onmainwindow.{cpp,h},configdialog.cpp}: remove userSshd variable
      and code related to non-user-mode-sshd setups. Simplifies code a bit and
      we want to always start a user-mode OpenSSH server anyway. Also get rid
      of the clientport variable that is now unnecessary.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: when starting sshd on Unix-based plattforms, raise
      maximum startup time to 5 seconds and break out early, if the process
      went into running state earlier.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: uppercase key type in debug output and comment
      string in generateKey ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: terminate sshd more correctly. First via terminate
      (), then wait up to 5 seconds, then via kill ().
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add new function check_key_type (). Takes a
      key type and checks for validity/if it's known.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add new function key_type_to_string ().
      Returns a stringified version of the selected key type, after checking
      for validity.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add new function default_size_for_key_type ().
      Returns the default key size in bits for the selected key type, after
      checking for validity.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: use the new functions in generateKey ().
    - src/onmainwindow.h: move generateKey () declaration around.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: reformat generateKey () only.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: move createRSAKey () around.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: reformat createRSAKey () only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: let startSshd () act as a wrapper and be called
      multiple times. Check if the OpenSSH Server is already running and
      return true, otherwise try to start it.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add some comments only to createRSAKey ().
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: rename createRSAKey () to the more-appropriate
      name createKeyBundle (). Also add a key-type parameter and use it to
      select the required key type (and maybe generate it if necessary.) Also
      use the new functions to get a stringified version of the key type etc.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PA 9.0.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: move QProcess startup check in startSshd () to
      non-Windows code section and add a listening socket check loop. Windows
      uses other means of starting the daemon.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add comment to last all-in listening check in
      startSshd ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add listening-check loop to the Windows-specific
      code of startSshd ().
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: make startSshd () private. There's no need to
      keep it public, as only class-internal functions are using it.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add ssh_key_type_ member variable and getter
      and setter to WinServerStarter class.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: add SSH key type parameter to startSshd ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: pass new ssh_key_type_ member to startSshd () call
      in WinServerStarter::run ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: pass key_type parameter to startSshd () in
      createKeyBundle ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add and use key_types parameter to
      startWinServers ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: actually use key_type parameter in startSshd ()
      and make selection more generic.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: move WinServerStarter class definition around to
      hopefully get the definition of ONMainWindow::key_types.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: remove WWrapper definition, seems to be unused.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: don't try to initialize non-static
      ssh_key_type_ member variable directly, but in the constructor. Also,
      use the initializer list to initialize the other member variables
      directly.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: re-order initializer list of WinServerStarter
      constructor.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: actually, we do need startSshd () to be public. Move
      it back.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: only pass non-Cygwin paths to QFile::exists () in
      generateKey (). Refactor a bit to drop the now-unnecessary ret variable.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: use QFileInfo to get the key file's basename in
      exportDirs () instead of the old, potentially faulty string replace
      dance.
    - src/x2goutils.{cpp,h}: make find_binary () and add_to_path () available
      on all UNIX-based operating systems. We will need it for sftp-server
      discovery.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: refactor PA binary searching code. Less
      duplication now.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix sshd_config generation on UNIX by searching
      for the real sftp-server binary path.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix PA binary searching logic. We don't want to
      unconditionally set system_pulse_ to true if we found a binary... it
      might as well be the bundled one...
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: move generateEtcFiles () call to startSshd (). We
      must make sure that the sshd_config file exists and is up-to-date, so
      let's always do it right before starting the sshd binary.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: stop duplicating the list of known sftp-server
      binary locations.
    - src/{onmainwindow,pulsemanager}.cpp: actually *use* what we got back
      from add_to_path ()... Fixes a few bugs here and there.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: remove trailing slash from Mageia/SUSE/Arch
      sftp-server binary search path.
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: add debugging output to add_to_path ().
    - src/x2goutils.cpp: fix add_to_path (). We want to remove trailing
      slashes from elements-to-add, not just fetch a trailing slash if
      encountered. Also, better don't compare a value from the original path
      value to itself, but rather to the things we want to add in order to
      remove duplicates, not remove most of the list of elements to add...
    - src/unixhelper.cpp: use cstdio instead of stdio.h. It's the C++ header
      and imports functions into the std namespace.
    - src/: create new file unix_stdint.h which imports the (u)int*_t types
      into the std namespace.
    - src/pulsemanager.h: use unix_stdint.h on non-Windows-platforms to get
      std::(u)int*_t types without having to use C++11.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: fix Linux-based code by fixing a really stupid
      typo ("erange" instead of "errno") and including the cerrno header.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: use std::ssize_t for the path length, because it
      could be -1 and std::size_t is not applicable.
    - src/pulsemanager.cpp: cast the return value of realloc () to char*, as
      GCC doesn't seem to like reassigning the pointer otherwise.
    - src/unix_stdint.h: use same hack to import ssize_t into std namespace.
    - src/onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: remove left-over parec references and code.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: convert piece of code to non-Windows and
      non-Darwin, so that not only Linux but other operating systems are
      covered as well.
    - src/mediawidget.cpp: unify some redundant code.
    - src/mediawidget.cpp: simplify expression.
    - src/mediawidget.cpp: add deprecation warning for ARTS.
    - src/mediawidget.cpp: add deprecation warning for ESounD.
    - macbuild.sh: make compatible with new llvm-based otool binary, which now
      uses proper return values. Be backwards-compatible with otool-classic.
    - res/i18n/: refresh translation files.
    - deduplicate.sh: remove file, now obsolete and merged into macbuild.sh.
    - res/i18n/: refresh translation files again after copyright date changes.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_fr.ts: fixup French translation file.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_sv.ts: fixup Swedish translation file a little bit
      and add comments/requests for re-translations for the next time.
    - macbuild.sh: switch to bundling PulseAudio 10.0 since it's now available
      in MacPorts.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: no need to put new_argv_c_str std::vector onto the
      heap. Keep it on the stack.
    - src/x2goclient.cpp: use $PATH-exploration when re-executing x2goclient
      in UNIX cleanup helper mode. Fixes: #1139.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: correctly initialize pulseManager and
      pulseManagerThread member variables. Fixes crashes on OS X and Windows
      if X2Go Client terminates before these objects have been created at run
      time (for instance when running x2goclient --help.)
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: correctly guard the new lines from the previous
      commit. Fixes compile issues on Linux and other systems.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_es.ts: fixup Spanish translation file where
      necessary and add comments/requests for re-translations for the next
      time.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_es.ts: remove obsolete comments and very minor
      whitespace fixup.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_de.ts: fixup German translation file, including
      typo, whitespace, grammar fixes and other stuff.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_sv.ts: remove obsolete comments and very minor
      whitespace fix.
    - macbuild.sh: sanitize find input, as BSD find and GNU find behave
      differently.
    - macbuild.sh: get rid of problems and use gfind directly. We need special
      GNU features.
    - src/appdialog.cpp: logic so that X2Go-Top applications are shown again.
      Used faulty logic when silencing compiler warnings.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_fi.ts: fix up Finnish translation file, including
      typo, whitespace fixes and marking untranslated entries as such again,
      after removing the English "translation" text.

  [ Bernard Cafarelli ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - {res/,x2goclient.pro}: rename .rcc files to .qrc. Fixes: #1096. "rcc" is
      the extension for compiled resource files, whereas "qrc" is the mapping
      file. Qt5 stumbles upon that - i.e., it doesn't try to compile files
      with the "rcc" extension, while Qt4 did.
    - res/: fix up previous change, the renaming of changelog.qrc was not
      correctly committed.

x2goclient (4.0.5.2-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Klaus Ade Johnstad ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.2):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: update Bokmål (Norway) translation file.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.2):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: fixup translation by respecting the
      original messages' format, typo fixes and other changes.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_fi.ts: fixup translation by respecting the original
      messages' format and other changes.
    - src/{ongetpass,onmainwindow}.cpp: fixup QPlastiqueStyle usage on Qt5.
      This particular style has been removed/replaced by Fusion, which
      incorporates features of both Plastique and Clearlooks styles.
    - x2goclient.spec: whitespace only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add (default) MacPorts prefix, /usr/local/bin and
      /opt/X11/bin to x2goclient's environment and child environments before
      starting xmodmap. Fixes: #1019. Requires a re-release of X2Go Client for
      OS X.
    - src/x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new function add_to_path () to add multiple
      entries to a PATH-like string if they do not exist in there yet.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: replace old code to modify the PATH value with the
      new add_to_path () function.
    - src/{onmainwindow,sshmasterconnection}.cpp: refactoring and whitespace only
      changes following up the #1027 patch.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: add new enum for selecting SSH host key types.
    - src/onmainwindow.h: rename ONMainWindow::generateHostDsaKey () to
      ONMainWindow::generateHostKey () and make key type selectible. Fixes:
      #1003. Host key type selection currently only works within the code. Replace
      calls to former ONMainWindow::generateHostDsaKey () with the generalized
      function and request an RSA-type key.
    - src/help.cpp: actually make help descriptions translatable. Looks ugly
      and is cumbersome to use, but there seems to be no other way to do
      that...
    - src/help.h: typo fix in comment only.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: add some comments related to maybe using
      add_to_path ().
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: work around changed SSH host key locations in OS X
      10.11+. Fixes: #1079. Also check /etc/ssh/ for keys.
    - src/onmainwindow.cpp: fix last commit by using QFileInfo instead of
      QDir. This lets us use the exists () member function correctly.
    - {nsis/x2goclient.nsi,res/i18n/x2goclient_{da,es,et,fi,nl,zh_tw}.ts}:
      replace left-overs of "X2go" with the correct "X2Go" spelling.
      This mostly touches obsolete strings and file names, that need to be
      cleaned, but it's still worthwhile to not have it show up when searching
      for the old string. Given that NTFS is normally case-insensitive,
      removing the files will still work.
  * debian/control:
    - Maintainer change in package: X2Go Developers <x2go-dev@lists.x2go.org>.
    - Uploaders: add myself. Also, force a rebuild due to the changed
      versioning.

    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.66 to 0.67, which fixes
      CVE-2016-2563.
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1q to 1.0.1t,

x2goclient (4.0.5.1-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - onmainwindow.cpp: include sshd PID file path option in quotes to support
      whitespaces within the var directory path on Windows. Add comment to
      revisit this later on non-Windows-platforms, too. Fixes: #916.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: do NOT reformat. Reverts most of the previous commit
      because it breaks code logic.
    - res/txt/packs: add adaptive method.
    - {macbuild.sh,x2goclient.pro}: pass MacPorts library and include path's
      to qmake. Due to the qt4-mac's changes, we do not automatically get
      these values automatically "appended" in a usable way anymore.
    - x2gosettings.cpp: let centralSettings () return false on Windows.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: be more precise in slotScDaemonError () regarding
      unknown and undefined errors.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: don't use a hardcoded path to xmodmap on OS X and
      handle errors more gracefully. Fixes: #487.
    - x2goclient.pro: fix typo --stdlib=... -> -stdlib=... Fixes: #973.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add some more error handling for parsing the return
      value of x2golistsessions. As it turns out, it can happen that "invalid"
      strings are inserted in there, for instance by the perl interpreter
      itself. We need to skip over these, or the client crashes when splitting
      up the invalid lines.
    - macbuild.sh: add stdlib forcing. Should not be used unless you really
      know what you're doing. If you ponder using this, you probably don't.
    - res/resources.rcc: add Turkish translation file. Fixes: #987.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: use lowercase version of locale. Fixes: #953.
      Fixes loading up the nb_NO translation file, which is actually baked as
      nb_no into the binary.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: let challenge-auth-based login attempts
      fallback to normal password authentication if the initial
      challenge-auth-based attempt was unsuccessful.
    - sshmasterconnection.{cpp,h}: support variable number of
      challenge-auth-code-based prompts.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't check prompts for full string equality -
      a matching prefix is good enough. Amongst others, this fixes errors in
      conditions where the prompt does not contain a trailing whitespace, but
      X2Go Client expects one.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: add OATH TOTP prompt prefix. Fixes: #860.
    - res/i18n: refresh translation files again.
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: replace "X-Serv..." with "X.Org Server"

  * debian/control:
    - Change apache2-dev | libc6-dev build dependency back to apache2-dev
      only. Otherwise, apache2-dev is not installed at all, even though
      theoretically available. The initial reasoning for this dependency type,
      apache2-dev not being available on all Ubuntu/Debian platforms, is not
      true anymore.
    - Change apache2-dev build dependency yet again to apache2-dev |
      apache2-threaded-dev. Turns out all Debian distros but wheezy (currently
      oldstable) have an apache2-dev package. Even oldoldstable (squeeze)
      does...

      start with a dash ("-"). (Fixes: #948).

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1p to 1.0.1q,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-12-03.
    - Windows: Upgrade Cygwin components to latest versions as of
      2016-01-21, except for the Cygwin DLL which is still at 1.7.33
      in order to avoid breaking folder sharing and printer sharing
      due to 1.7.34's ACL/permissions changes.
      (authorized_keys file would often have mode 660 instead of 600)
      The latest components include most notably:
        + openssh 6.8p1-1-x2go1 -> 7.1p2-1-x2go1 (security update)
        + openssl 1.0.2d-1 -> 1.0.2e-1 (security update)
    - Windows: Update nxproxy from 3.5.0.31 to 3.5.0.32
    - Windows: Update Unicode NSIS from 2.46.5 to 2.50.0 Pre-release,
      which fixes the DLL hijacking security vuln (NSIS bug 1125.)
    - Windows: Update PuTTY from 0.64 to 0.66, which fixes
      CVE-2015-5309.
    - Windows: Remove libzip. libssh no longer uses it.

  [ Orion Poplawski ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.1):
    - ssh{process,masterconnection}.cpp: run bash as a login shell when
      invoking any command remotely. Fixes: #928. Because this opens the door
      for ~/.bash_logout and friend scripts to be executed, which may contain
      calls to ncurses' reset or clear, also set the TERM variable to dump to
      not have unexpected output on stderr at logout time.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: check correct variable for validity: public key
      instead of private key (again.) Fixes: #945.

  [ Klaus Ade Johnstad ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):
    - res/i18n/x2goclient_nb_no.ts: update Bokmål (Norway) translation file.

  [ Heinrich Schuchardt ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: don't fetch invalid proxy socket. Fixes: #1000.
      From http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qabstractsocket.html#socketDescriptor:
      The socket descriptor is not available when QAbstractSocket is in
      UnconnectedState.
      So we have to connect to the proxy server first before retrieving the
      native socket.

  [ Daniel Lindgren ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.5.1):

x2goclient (4.0.5.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - INSTALL: add more verbose instructions on how to build X2Go Client and
      friends.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: rename slotScDaemonOut() and slotScDaemonError()
      to slotScDaemonStdOut() and slotScDaemonStdErr(). I will need
      slotScDaemonError() later and the previous names were a bit of a
      misnomer.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: add new show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox() main function
      designed to replace the show_RichText_WarningMsgBox() function.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: make show_RichText_WarningMsgBox() use
      show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox ().
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: new show_RichText_ErrorMsgBox() function as a wrapper
      for show_RichText_Generic_MsgBox() with a critical icon.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: properly handle scdaemon errors with a message box
      and close the client.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: manipulate PATH and append /usr/lib/gnupg2/ to it when
      starting scdaemon. Fixes: #882.
    - x2goutils.h: add QMessageBox include, fixed compile error.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix typos leading to compile errors.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add blocks to switch cases to fix a compile error.
      Also correctly append to informative_text on one occasion, instead of
      overwriting it.
    - x2goutils.cpp: correct typo to fix compile errors.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: drop a redundant variable and fix empty env check.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add more newlines to scdaemon error output. Use
      trayQuit() method to really quit the client.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: add debugging output for new scdaemon PATH value.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: split up PATH value as printed in the error message
      box by a newline every 100 characters. Makes it look less ugly and fixes
      truncation issues.
    - sshprocess.cpp: export PATH variable when running commands. Otherwise,
      only the first one will respect the new PATH value.
    - sshprocess.cpp: wrap SSH command prelude and conclusion in double
      quotes.
    - sshprocess.cpp: wrap all remote commands with "bash" instead of the
      unspecific "sh".
    - onmainwindow.cpp: try to escape shell quotes correctly when using
      Kerberos/GSSApi when running the xmodmap keyboard sync command on OS X.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: also escape other shell quotes when using
      Kerberos/GSSApi.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: silence compiler warning by casting an int value to
      std::size_t.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: silence another compiler warning by not converting
      from string to int and back to string needlessly. Just use the string.
      No need for an OS X-specific variable anymore.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error - use QString.toAscii () to get a
      valid C string representation for tr ().
    - onmainwindow.cpp: don't terminate if scdaemon exited with non-zero exit
      code.
    - sshprocess.cpp: don't use QProcess::start (QString). Qt is trying to be
      too smart and causes big trouble. Instead, use QProcess::start (QString,
      QStringList) and pass the arguments as a list. On Windows, Qt will
      automatically double quote the arguments and duplicate escaped double
      quotes or escape non-escaped double quotes. On UNIX-like platforms, each
      element of the list is passed as a unique argv element, so there's no
      need for quoting them (that's only a shell-internal thing to group
      arguments.)
    - sshprocess.cpp: add a bit more debugging - also print out the unmodified
      raw output of SSH commands.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: remove now-bogus double quote escaping.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: port QProcess::start () change.
    - sshprocess.cpp: whitespace/prettify only and a compile fix.
    - x2goclient.pro: reinstate old lrelease "search" behavior if
      qtPrepareTool() is not available. This should only happen on EPEL 6,
      which ships a broken Qt4 version...
    - onmainwindow.cpp: only set multidisplay mode for non-rootless sessions.
    - {ui/xsettingsui.ui,xsettingswidget.cpp}: add new "whole display" option
      for external X server configuration. Part of #883.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: rename "optionsmd" setting to "optionswholedisplay",
      which is more clear.
    - xsettingswidget.cpp: fix compile error: settings -> setting.
    - sessionmanagedialog.cpp: enable some debugging and make selected
      sessions configureable or deletable. Fixes: #909.

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * debian/control:
    + Add alternative D for nxproxy: qvd-nxproxy. Allows parallel installation
      of X2Go Client and the TheQVD client (perl-qvd-client).

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1m to 1.0.1p,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
      CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
    - Windows: Upgrade the MSVC 2008 DLLs (9.0.21022.8) to the
      MSVC 2013 DLLs (12.0.21005.1), which Win32 OpenSSL now requires.
    - Windows: Only bundle msvcr120.dll; The other 2 MSVC DLLs aren't
      needed by Win32 OpenSSL.
    - Windows: Update bundled Cygwin OpenSSL from 1.0.2a-1 to 1.0.2d-1, which
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
      CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
    - Windows: Update bundled VcXsrv from 1.17.0.0-1 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      to 1.17.0.0-3 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of openssl was updated from 1.0.2a
          to 1.0.2d (fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-06-11 and
          CVE-2015-1793 (announced on 2015-07-09).
        + Drop winmultiwindow.patch (Part of #883)
        + hw/xwin/glx: Don't create fbConfigs for un-accelerated
          pixelFormats
          This has the effect of disabling StaticColor under
          MultiWindow mode with -wgl (default) and -swrastwgl, and
          thus making X2Go sessions started from the Windows client
          able to be resumed on the client on a different OS or the
          client runing on Windows with different display settings.
          (Fixes: #696)
    - Linux: Fix desktop session icons (.desktop files) failing due to
      missing space between "x2goclient" and its 1st argument
      (e.g. "--session") (Fixes: #911)

  [ Henning Heinold ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - x2goclient.pro: simplify lrelease path preparing for different OS and
      cross compiling. Fixes: #901.

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.5.0):
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: fix multimonitor mode on Windows. Run VcXsrv on
      selected screen without decorations.

x2goclient (4.0.4.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.4.0):
    - Windows: Do not delete saved PuTTY sessions when Kerberos 5
      (GSSAPI) authentication is enabled (Fixes: #625/#789)
    - Windows: Fix "Connection failed" "pscp" error with folder
      sharing when Kerberos 5 (GSSAPI) auth is used, and the
      server-side home dir is at a path other than /home/$USER
      (Fixes: #868)
    - Windows: Fix audio (PulseAudio) when Kerberos 5
      (GSSAPI) authentication is used (Fixes: #869)
    - Windows: Include debug build in the regular installer.
      It is an optional component during the install. It is not
      installed by default.
    - Windows: Include Pageant and PuTTYgen in the installer.
      They are optional components during the install. They are
      installed by default.
    - Windows: Add descriptions for the "components" in the installer
      (English language only at this time)
    - Windows: You can now view the version and some other info by:
      right-click on the installer -> Properties -> Details
      (English language only at this time)
    - Windows: Upgrade bundled PulseAudio from 5.0-rev18 to 6.0-11.1
      (No known impacts to X2Go, except for the fact that many needed
       patches are now included in upstream PulseAudio.)
    - Windows: Upgrade bundled VcXsrv from 1.15.2.2-xp+vc2013+x2go1 to
      1.17.0.0-1 (X2Go/Arctica Build)
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150508 has an
      update to 1.15.2.6 (X2Go/Arctica), which fixes all the CVEs.
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + Numerous X.org components were upgraded to new major/minor
          versions.
        + CVE-2015-0255 was fixed in VcXsrv itself
        + CVE-2015-3418 was fixed in VcXsrv itself
        + Font files no longer differ in each build due to timestamp
          differences
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of openssl was upgraded from 1.0.1k
          to 1.0.2a (fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-03-19)
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of libXfont was upgraded from 1.4.8
          to 1.5.1 (Fixes CVE-2015-1802 through CVE-2015-1804)
        + VcXsrv's bundled version of freetype was updated from 2.5.3
          to 2.5.5 (fixes CVE-2014-9656 through CVE-2014-9675)
    - Windows: Update bundled Win32 OpenSSL from 1.0.1L to 1.0.1m,
      which fixes the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-03-19.
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150329 has this update
      also.
    - Windows: Update bundled PuTTY from 0.63 to 0.64.
      In addition to other changes, CVE-2015-2157 has been fixed.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.6.4 to 0.7.0 (while maintaining
      Pageant support).
      The differences relevant to X2Go are:
        + CVE-2015-3146 was fixed
        + Added support for ed25519 keys
        + Added SHA2 algorithms for HMAC
      Note that X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2-20150508 has the update
      to 0.6.5, which fixes the CVE also.
    - Windows: Update bundled nxproxy (nx-libs-lite) from 3.5.0.27 to
      3.5.0.31. (bugfix & feature update)
    - Windows: Update/Upgrade bundled Cygwin components to latest
      versions as of 2015-04-25 (except for the Cygwin DLL, which was
      upgraded but not to the latest version).
      Note that all the security fixes were included in updates to
      X2Go Client for Windows 4.0.3.2
        + openssl 1.0.1k-1 -> 1.0.2a-1 (upgrade. includes security fixes
          for the multiple CVEs announced on 2015-03-19.)
        + libjpeg-turbo 1.8.1-1 -> 1.8.1-3 (security update for
          CVE-2014-9092)
        + libpng 1.5.21-2 -> libpng16 1.6.17-1 (upgrade, may improve X2Go
          performance when PNG compression is selected. Also includes the
          fix for CVE-2013-6954)
        + gcc 4.8.3-3 -> 4.9.2-3 (upgrade, may improve X2Go performance a
          little bit)
        + openssh 6.6p1-3-x2go1 -> 6.8p1-1-x2go1 (upgrade, probably not
          relevant to X2Go)
        + cygwin (DLL) 1.7.32-1 -> 1.7.33-1 (upgrade, probably not
          relevant to X2Go)
        + dash 0.5.8-2 -> 0.5.8-3 (feature update, not relevant to X2Go)
        + ncurses 5.9-20140524-1 -> 5.9-20150404-1 (update, probably
          not relevant to X2Go)
        + zlib 1.2.8-1 -> 1.2.8-3 (update, undocumented by Cygwin project)
    - Windows: Copy the exact version of each cygwin DLL from the cygwin
      binary tarballs rather than copying the "rebased" version from
      an X2Go developer's cygwin installation.
      What effect this will have on users is TBD. However, it does mean
      that we are distributing the exact DLLs that the Cygwin project
      provides, which is desirable for security.

    - Define the new variables $SDK and $MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET in
      macbuild.sh which can also be (pre-)set through the environment. Default
      to the 10.7 SDK and deployment target. Use the variables when calling
      qmake.
    - Specify -spec macx-g++ when using qmake in macbuild.sh.
    - Directly reference project file for qmake in macbuild.sh.

      behavior according to SUS.
    - Define and implement new function 'make_boolean()' in macbuild.sh. Takes
      a pseudo-boolean value and outputs either 0 or 1. Use this function.
    - Move functions to the start of the macbuild.sh script.
    - New env var/parameter UNIVERSAL in macbuild.sh. Switches the build

      links. Add MacPorts reference.
    - configdialog.cpp: reformat code, add MacPorts and XQuartz references,
      URL's and installation instructions, don't show outdated version warning
      when no XQuartz server is installed. Fixes: #792.
    - x2goutils.{h,cpp}: use QString references.
    - x2goutils.{h,cpp}: add new helper function show_RichText_WarningMsgBox.
    - configdialog.cpp: use new helper function show_RichText_WarningMsgBox to
      show proper errors. Format as HTML. Use hyperlinks. Rephrase XQuartz
      warning messages.

      application if no valid one could be found in order to show the proper
      error message.
    - configdialog.cpp: rephrase another error message, use the new helper and
      reformat code.

    - x2goclient.pro{,.maemo}: add new help.{cpp,h} files.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: replace old help system with new one.
    - {{onmainwindow,help}.cpp},help.h}: fix misc. build errors.

      write to.
    - help.cpp: clear current string if completely written onto one line.
    - help.cpp: enable debugging for pretty_print(). --debug must be supplied
      before --help for this to work.
    - help.cpp: fix splitting algorithm to step over a space character, but
      include hyphens correctly into the current line.
    - help.cpp: don't let qCritical() add even more spaces or quotes around
      the help message.
    - help.cpp: add support for newlines within descriptions.
    - help.cpp: use new newline feature for some options.
    - help.cpp: trying to split at hyphens was a bad idea. Remove that part.

      (caused by a typo) on Windows.
    - help.cpp: hardcode indentation value to 2 (for the first spaces) +
      maximum length of parameters + 4 (for the trailing 4 spaces).
      Calculations via terminal_cols and remaining do not work, if
      terminal_cols is unknown.
    - x2goutils.{cpp,h}: implement new git_changelog_extract_commit_sha
      helper, extracting the most recent commit shasum from a git changelog

      building the help prelude.
    - helpdialog.cpp: change to monospaced font.
    - helpdialog.cpp: use QT_VERSION macro to select either a monospaced or

    - helpdialog.cpp: try harder to set a monospaced font.
    - helpdialog.cpp: lower font size to have more space for text.
    - ui/helpdialog.ui: almost double the window size.
    - help.cpp: typo fix for --git-info.
    - help.{cpp,h}: provide string splitting logic as separate
      split_long_line() function. Use this in pretty_print().
    - help.cpp: simplify pretty_print() and make it also split lines for
      non-terminal output or when the terminal width is unknown.
    - help.{cpp,h}: add a boolean terminal_output parameter to the
      pretty_print() function family. Controls terminal width auto-detection
      and automatic printing to stderr.

      PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG setting once more.
    - {macbuild,res/osxbundle/postbuild}.sh: add support for git information
      if not building from a tag. Also includes build date.
    - {{configdialog,onmainwindow}.cpp,x2goutils.{cpp,h}}: new helper
      functions show_XQuartz_not_found_error(), show_XQuartz_start_error() and
      show_XQuartz_generic_error(). The first two are calling the latter one.
      Replace previous messages in configdialog.cpp and onmainwindow.cpp with
      the helpers, because they are supposed to pop up a dialog showing almost
      the same message.
    - x2goutils.cpp: fix compile error. tr () is a member of QObject and must
      be explicitly marked as such in a free function.
    - {configdialog.{cpp,h},onmainwindow.cpp}: miscellaneous typo fixes - no
      functional changes.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: whitespace changes to installTranslator() only.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly let Qt fetch the UI display language for Qt
      4.8.0 and higher. The old "compat" behavior is retained for older
      versions of Qt, which do not have the semantics of a UI display
      language. Fixes: #845.
    - config_win.bat: enable release by default, fetch command line parameter
      and compare against debug. Enable debug and console features in that
      case.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: follow-up to last translation fix. Actually handle
      English locales correctly and don't duplicate code too much.
    - onmainwindow.{cpp,h}: make new get_translator() function static. Correct
      typo in implementation.
    - onmainwindow.h: include used types/headers.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: correctly call QLocale::uiLanguages ().
    - onmainwindow.cpp: copy strings before manipulating them.
    - onmainwindow.h: make get_translator() const. Does not change any state.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: fix compile error triggered by a missing
      parenthesis/typo.
    - onmainwindow.cpp: workaround https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-25973.
    - onmainwindow.h: revert const-qualifier for get_translator(). It's static
      and can't have any cv-qualifier.
    - copy-deps-win32.bat: actually let xcopy error correctly.
    - general: improve debug output and error messages.

x2goclient (4.0.3.2-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Fix placement of session folders in session card column. (Fixes: #681).
    - Send empty message in x2gohelper to stop AppStarting cursor. (Fixes: #616).
    - Fix multiple creations of modmap timer (OS_DARWIN).

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Add several info/error/debug log message while hunting down #702.
    - Use app.setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(false) for the X2Go Client QtApplication
      to assure that X2Go Client does not arbitrarily exit during a running
      session. This fixes X2Go Client crashes that occur when printing via
      the CUPS-X2Go printing mechanism with activate print dialog popup on
      incoming print jobs and minimized main window. (Fixes: #702).
    - Be more exact when reporting rev forwarding tunnel request failures to
      the GUI user. Include the purpose of the tunnel (NX, audio, foldersharing)
      in the error message.
    - Enable debugging in sshprocess.cpp and sshmasterconnection.cpp if
      --debug is given.
    - sshmasterconnection.cpp: Fix several grammar issues in error messages.
    - When sharing a client-side folder, do not write the SSH pub key to
      client-side authorized_keys file if the folder-to-be-shared does not
      exist on the client. (Partially solves #405).
    - Fix string concatenation/layout of error message when tunnel I/O errors
      occur.
    - Improve debugging/logging the SSH connections made by X2Go Client.
    - Fix quotes when calling remote commands via SSH (esp. allow same quoting/
      escaping style for libssh and openSSH+Krb based connections). (Fixes: #720).
    - FIXME: Disable PubkeyAuthentication _and_ PasswordAuthentication if
      GSSAPI authentication is activated. This is counter intuitive, though,
      and requires several other fixes in the authentication code.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    - Always set BuildRoot: parameter.

  [ Sergey Savko ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Prevent passwordless re-logins into X2Go Session Broker if
      --broker-autologoff is used on the cmdline. (Fixes: #782).
    - Add new cmdline option --broker-noauth-use-session-username.
      When --broker-noauth is used, the broker does not know on behalf
      of which user to operate. This new option enables username syncing.
      When logging into X2Go Server, that username will be sent to the
      broker and be used for querying X2Go Broker Agents etc. (Fixes: #781).

  [ Heinrich Schuchardt ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Base the layout dialogue "Session ID" (which shows up when starting a
      connection) on typographic points (instead of pixels). (Fixes: #713).

  [ Jason Alavaliant ]
  * New upstream verson (4.0.3.2):
    - Use QUrl::toPercentEncoding() method to properly encode passwords sent
      to X2Go Session Broker. (Fixes: #705).

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.2):
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updates from 1.0.1j to 1.0.1L, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2015-01-08.
    - Windows: Cygwin OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1j-1 to 1.0.1k-1, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2015-01-08.
    - Windows: Bundle new version of VcXsrv: 1.15.2.2-xp+vc2013+x2go1.
      The differences from 1.15.2.1-xp+vc2013+x2go1 are that its bundled
      OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1k, and that xorg-server
      CVE-2014-8091..8103 have been fixed.
    - Windows: Update libssh from 0.6.3 to 0.6.4 (while maintaining
      Pageant support). This fixes CVE-2014-8132, which shouldn't
      affect x2goclient because x2goclient uses the SSH client
      functionality, not the SSH server functionality.
      0.6.4 also added 4 features related to ECDSA keys.
    - Windows: Fix compatibility with PulseAudio 6.0
    - Windows: Remove workaround for audio input with old versions of
      PulseAudio (calling parec once per second)
      (Fixes: #742)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting this change.
    - Windows: Enable X2Go Client for Windows to build under VS2010 nmake
      (but not the VS2010 IDE due to a Qt4 Visual Studio Add-in limitation)
      Note that the official builds are still build under MinGW.
      (Fixes: #642)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting this feature.
    - Windows: Make builds easier, and updating bundled dependencies
      easier, by adding copy-deps-win32.bat. It copies the exact
      version of each dependency (DLL, executable, data, folder, etc)
      from x2goclient-contrib.git.

      documented so far.
    - Make sound options configurable via X2Go Session Broker. (Fixes: #652).
    - Fix (cross-user) desktop sharing since introduction of clipboard mode
      feature.
    - Update several translation files after splitting of session profile's
      "Settings" tab into "Input/Output" and "Media". Translations for these
      two new tabs derived from the i18n files of PyHoca-GUI.

x2goclient (4.0.3.0-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Disallow server-side users to override X2Go Server commands via
      ~/bin (or similar). (Fixes: #336).
    - Avoid unitialised variables on early calls of ONMainWindow::closeEvent()
      or ONMainWindow::closeClient(). (Fixes: #253).
    - Update translation files. Add empty Portuguese translation. Update
      qt_<lang>.qm files from Debian unstable as of today.
    - Update German translation file (after session folder feature got added).
    - Makefile.man2html: Test if man2html exists. If not, don't fail.
    - Honor exports (client-side shared folders) from broker session profiles.
      Thanks to Ming Song for providing a patch for this (Fixes: 612).
  * debian/control:
    + Add B-D: apache2-dev. On squeeze / lucid builds, this is a superfluous
      B-D, but for later Debian/Ubuntu versions, this smoothes the installation
      of the x2goplugin-provide bin:package.
    + Update B-D: apache2-dev | libc6-dev. The apache2-dev package does not
      exist on all Debian/Ubuntu versions.
  * x2goclient.spec:
    + Adapt to building for openSUSE/SLES.
    + openSUSE: Make Qt4 Linguist tools available for Makefile.
    + Upgrade versioned BR for libssh-devel (0.6.3 or patched 0.5.5).
    + The libqt4-linguist split off happened in openSUSE 13.1.
    + Add x2goclient-rpmlintrc file.
    + In openSUSE, it is openldap2-devel, in Fedora/RHEL it is openldap-devel.

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.3.0):
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Cinnamon (CINNAMON) desktop environment.
      (Fixes: #571)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Trinity (TRINITY) desktop environment.
      (Fixes: #609)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the Openbox (OPENBOX) window manager.
      (Fixes: #607)
    - Make X2Go Client aware of the IceWM (ICEWM) window manager.
      (Fixes: #608)
    - Windows: Fix not being able to add the server to the known_hosts file when
      the username has non-English characters. (Fixes: #566)
      (NOTE: This fix only works when the non-English characters are in the same
      language as the Windows "system locale" AKA "Language for non-Unicode
      programs." Bug #611 was written for fixing the issue for languages other
      than the system locale.)
      Thanks George Trakatelis (uom.edu.gr) for submitting part of this fix.
    - Windows: Install VcXsrv "misc" fonts by default, and make all 4 font
      groups optional: misc, 75dpi, 100dpi and others (Fixes: #108)
      Note: The fact that all the fonts are included makes the installer about
      30MB larger.
    - Windows: Bundle new version of VcXsrv: 1.15.2.1-xp+vc2013+x2go1
      This new version is based on upstream VcXsrv 1.15.2.0, but still
      compatible with Windows XP. It also has its bundled OpenSSL updated to
      1.0.1j. It is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and contains 1
      X2Go-specific change, winmultiwindow.patch. This patch fixes an issue
      when resizing the NX-proxy window on specific multiple monitor setups.
      (Thanks Oleksandr Shneyder for the patch) (Fixes: #568) (Fixes: #594)
    - Windows: Port from MinGW 4.4 + Qt 4.8.5 to MinGW 4.8.2 + Qt 4.8.6,
      including fix for QTBUG-38706 (Fixes: #474, #603)
    - Windows: Fix missing VcXsrv/zlib1.dll . The impact of this bug was that
      VcXsrv would not start if the cwd was changed from the x2goclient
      directory. (The start menu and desktop shortcuts do have the x2goclient
      directory as the cwd. So they were not affected.) (Fixes: #587)
    - Windows: Make the desktop shortcut optional during install,
      but still the default.
    - Windows: Upgrade libssh from 0.5.5 to 0.6.3. This fixes connecting to
      hpn-enabled SSH servers. The Pageant support patch from the KDE Windows
      project was ported to 0.6.3 by myself and Mike Frederick.
      (Gmail: psududemike) (Fixes: #590)
    - Windows: Win32 OpenSSL updated from 1.0.1h to 1.0.1j, which fixes the
      CVEs announced on 2014-08-06 & 2014-10-15.
    - Windows: Replace Cygwin Bash (sh.exe) with Cygwin Dash (ash.exe renamed
      to sh.exe). This also means fewer Cygwin .DLLs are bundled.
      (Fixes: #636)
    - Windows: cygwin packages (excluding OpenSSH, which is at the patched
      version of 6.6.1p1-3-x2go1) updated from latest versions as of 2014-06-09
      to latest versions as of 2014-10-18. This includes openssl 1.0.1j-1, which
      fixes the CVEs announced on 2014-08-06 & 2014-10.15.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated in 4.0.2.1+hotfix1+build2,
      but only to 1.0.1i-1.)
    - Windows: Build nxproxy.exe with Cygwin's libpng 1.5.x rather than 1.2.x.
      (This may improve performance when PNG compression is selected.)
    - Windows: Build cygwin openssh without krb5 or tcp_wrappers support because
      X2Go Client for Windows does not use either feature.
      (On Windows, Kerberos 5 (GSSAPI) support is provided by PuTTY.)
    - Windows: Fix text not being rendered properly at end of NSIS installer
      (Fixes: #597)

    - Windows: Enable PulseAudio log when --debug is passed.
    - Windows: Fix compatibility with current PulseAudio master branch
    - Windows: cygwin packages (inluding patched OpenSSH 6.6.1p1-3) updated from
      latest versions as of 2014-04-08 to latest versions as of 2014-06-09. This
      includes openssl 1.0.1h-1, which fixes the 6 CVEs announced on 2014-06-05.
      (Cygwin openssl was also individually updated to 1.0.1h-1 in
      4.0.2.0+build4.) This also includes migrating from libjpeg to
      libjpeg-turbo, which reduces CPU usage of nxproxy.)
    - Windows: Download and compile nx-libs-lite from the release tarball,
      rather than from git, so that the patches are actually applied
    - Windows: nx-libs-lite updated from 3.5.0.22 to 3.5.0.27
